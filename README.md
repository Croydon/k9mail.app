# k9mail.app

This GitHub repository provides the source for [K-9 Mail's website](https://k9mail.app).

It is a combination of Markdown, HTML, CSS which is rendered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).


## Building the site

Read Jekyll's [Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) page to learn how to install the required software.

To build the site and make it available on a local server, type:

```text
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open http://localhost:4000/ in your browser.


## Writing a blog post

Blog posts are written using Markdown. Add a new file to the `_posts` directory.
When adding images, you can choose whether to align them to the left, middle or right just by adding an `<`, `><` or `>` at the end of the alt text for that image. If you want to know how to align other items, you can have a look at previous posts.
