excerpt: How much was donated and where did the money go?
---

On [I love Free Software Day](https://fsfe.org/activities/ilovefs/) (February 14) we published the blog post [K-9 Mail is looking for funding](https://k9mail.app/2021/02/14/K-9-Mail-is-looking-for-funding) to ask users of K-9 Mail for money to support the development of the app. The response was impressive.

I'm guessing most of you are interested in the numbers. So let's get that out of the way first.

### How was the money spent?

The [funding goal](https://k9mail.app/2021/02/14/K-9-Mail-is-looking-for-funding) was â‚¬1,000 per week (because that's how Liberapay rolls), or â‚¬52,000 per year, to allow [cketti](https://cketti.de/) â€“ the maintainer of K-9 Mail (and the author of this blog post ðŸ‘‹) â€“ to dedicate 80% of his time to work on K-9 Mail. 

Since the goal wasn't exceeded, we didn't have to figure out what to do with additional funds. All of the money was paid out to cketti (who is starting to like writing about himself in the third person).

To learn what the K-9 Mail project was up to in 2021, watch out for a blog post that will be published in the coming days.


### Thank you

A big thank you to all of the donors ðŸ’– It's great to see that K-9 Mail is so valuable to you that you are willing to give money, even though the app is free.
