excerpt: The release that adds customizable swipe actions.

The new stable release, **K-9 Mail 6.400**, adds customizable swipe actions, introduces swiping between messages, and fixes countless bugs (in reality, it would be quite easy to count them; just a lot of work and not much fun, so we didn't).
