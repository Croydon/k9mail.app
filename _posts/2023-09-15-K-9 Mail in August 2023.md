## A Quiet Yet Productive Month

August was a relatively calm month for the K-9 Mail team, with many taking well-deserved summer vacations and attending our first [Mozilla All-Hands event](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/09/thundercast-podcast-4-will-the-real-mozilla-please-stand-up/). Despite the quieter pace, we managed to hit a significant milestone on our journey to Thunderbird for Android: the beta release of our new account setup interface.


## Beta Release with New Account Setup: We Want Your Feedback!

We’re thrilled to announce that we rolled out a beta version featuring the new account setup UI. This has been a long-awaited feature, and even though the team was partially on vacation, we managed to get it out for user testing. The initial feedback has been encouraging, and we’re eager to hear your thoughts.
