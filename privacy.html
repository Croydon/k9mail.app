    <p class="text-main mb-3">K-9 Mail is an email client for Android that uses the user's email provider to send and
      retrieve messages. The app requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions:</p>
    <p class="text-main"><strong>Read/modify your Contacts</strong></p>
    <p class="text-main">The names and email addresses in the user's address book (contacts) are used to provide
      suggestions and auto-complete recipients when composing a message.</p>
    <p class="text-main"><strong>Read from/write to Storage (Photos/Media/Files)</strong></p>
    <p class="text-main">The storage area is used to save attachments or export app settings. It can also be used to
      import app settings or select files to attach to a message the user is composing.</p>
    <p class="text-main mt-4">For more information on the permissions K-9 Mail requires see: <a
        class="text-main underline" href="/documentation/permissions">Permissions</a>.</p>
    <p class="text-main mb-4">Sensitive user information is only used to perform the basic functionality of the app,
      sending and receiving email. K-9 Mail does not automatically collect and send data to the developers of the app or
      any third party. Sensitive information is also not included in application logs unless this is enabled by the
      user.</p>
